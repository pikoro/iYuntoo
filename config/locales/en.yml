    free:
      title: "It's free and fair"
      body: >
        Free accounts aren't treated like secondary citizens here. Everyone has 
        equal input into how the site works and the direction we take.
        If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or other feedback then we'd
        love to hear it! Send it over to
        <a href="mailto:support@photographer.io">support@photographer.io</a>.

    advertising:
      title: "No advertising"
      body: >
        We hate advertising, which is why you'll <b>never</b> see it on 
        Photographer.io. The site will soon be supported by subscriptions, and we
        may use affiliate links for camera gear etc in future; but we will never run
        adverts.
    
    money:
      title: "We make money in an obvious way"
      body: >
        There's no hocus pocus here. Subscriptions will be coming soon (and at a
        very reasonable price), and these are how the site will be funded. There
        are no investors, no advertisers, and no selling of your data.

    likes:
      title: "Likes are dead, long live the Recommendation"
      body: >
        We don't use 'Likes' on Photographer.io. Instead every user can make a
        maximum of %{quota} recommendations per day.
        A recommendation helps promote the photo on our 
        <a href="/photographs/recommended">recommended page</a> but will soon
        recommend the photo to your followers too.


        Recommendations should be given out for photos which you think are great,
        not necessarily the ones you love the most; that's what Favourites are for!

    comments:
      title: "Our commenting system is different"
      body: >
        Comments on Photographer.io work more like threads on a traditional 
        message board/forum; you choose a subject for people to comment on. This
        is aimed to help increase the amount of useful feedback you get, rather
        than "OMG LOVE IT". Comments are only visible to the creator and the photo
        owner by default (and the parent comment's owner if it's a reply). This
        means that you get to choose which comments appear on your photos. They
        are <i>your</i> photos after all; shouldn't you choose what appears
        alongside them?

    privacy:
      title: "Privacy and security are really important to us"
      body: >
        We take privacy and security seriously. The entire site and all related
        services (such as image hosting) are served over SSL, passwords are stored
        using <a href="http://bcrypt.sourceforge.net/">bcrypt</a>, and we respond

          Your photographs won't appear to the public until you have added them to a
          public collection! This is to make sure you don't accidentally publish
          images you aren't ready for people to see.
        recommendations: >
          You can recommend photographs from other users. This works similarly to
          'liking' a photograph elsewhere, except that you have a finite amount of
          recommendations you can make per day.

          are visible to you and the commenter by default, but you can make them public
          if you think they're worth displaying; this can be done via the public view

        body: |
          The following are the rough guidelines for uploading your photos to 
          Photographer.io. Following these will help ensure your images appear at their
          best!

          * Currently the only supported format is JPEG/JPG.
          * Use a high quality setting when saving as JPG, as we adjust the quality automatically.
          * It's recommended that you upload images of at least 2000 pixels in their largest dimension. This ensures that no scaling up will happen across the site.
          * The largest image size accessible by the public on the site is 2000px, which is used for the homepage images. It will be possible to opt-out of your images appearing there soon.
          * For individual photo pages the images are displayed at a maximum of 1500px in the largest dimension.
          * You can upload full-size JPGs from your camera; upload quotas are calculated by the number of images, not the size. However it's recommended that you use slightly smaller copies to reduce upload and processing time.
          * The original image you upload is not accessible by anyone but yourself, we generate smaller, optimised copies for use around the site.
