### Account Types and Restrictions

#### All Accounts
1. 30MB is currently the maximum size for uploaded photographs. The maximum size an image can be viewed on the site is 2000 pixels in the largest axis. For performance and plagiarism reasons we recommend you upload something around those pixel dimensions instead of the full-size original files. Original files are not accessible by others, and are only used for generating smaller versions.
2. You can "Recommend" up to 10 photographs per day. 
  * "Recommendations" affect the photos which appear in the "Recommended" section and help others discover your favourite images.

#### Free Accounts
The following account restrictions apply to members with free accounts:

1. You may upload a maximum of 100 photographs per month. This limit resets at the start of every month.
2. The upload limit can be increased through referring friends. You gain an extra 10 uploads per month for each friend you refer, up to a maximum of 10 friends.

#### Paid Accounts (coming soon)
Members who choose to pay a subscription fee ("Paid Account") receive the following benefits:

1. Unlimited uploads per month, though we retain the right to limit any user we consider to be abusing the Site, as outlined under "Fair Usage".
2. Additional features across the site, including:
  1. The ability to share private collections.
  2. The option to increase the number of photographs displayed per page.
  3. The ability to filter categories, preventing them from displaying for the Member whilst signed in.

The benefits available to Paid Accounts are liable to be modified over time. All members will be notified of modifications prior to implementation.

### Payments and Renewals
#### General Terms
Payment for Site services are made via Stripe Payments Europe, Ltd. By selecting a Paid Account you agree to pay the monthly or annual subscription fees for the chosen service. Payments will be charged on a pre-pay basis on the day you sign up for a Paid Account and will cover the use of that subscription for a monthly or annual duration.

#### Automatic Renewal
Your Paid Account will automatically renew at the end of the monthly or annual period unless you notify us in advance that you wish to cancel it. We will notify you two weeks in advance that your subscription is about to renew.
Unless you notify the Company before the end of the applicable subscription period that you want to cancel a Paid Account, your Paid Account will automatically renew and you authorize us to collect the applicable annual or monthly subscription fee (as well as any taxes). Subscriptions can be cancelled at any time in the Account section of the Site. Your account will remain a Paid Account until the end of the paid subscription period.

### Fair Usage
